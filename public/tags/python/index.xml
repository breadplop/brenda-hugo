      <description>How to Use Python with Google Spreadsheets Intro I recently wanted to pull data from Google Spreadsheets, do some manipulation using Python, and push the cleaned data back onto Google Spreadsheets.

I made use of the Mixpanel API and company&amp;rsquo;s database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.</description>
