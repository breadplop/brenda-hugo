      <description>How to Use Python with Google Spreadsheets Intro I recently wanted to pull data from Google Spreadsheets, do some manipulation using Python, and push the cleaned data back onto Google Spreadsheets.

So when I first entered my internship company, I noticed that sales/marketing data were all being tracked on Google Spreadsheets.</description>
