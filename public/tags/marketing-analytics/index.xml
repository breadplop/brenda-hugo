      <description>Hi guys, so today I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about marketing analytics. Being at Reonomy for a year, I have learnt a lot about marketing and how data is so important and crucial in marketing. I&amp;rsquo;d like to credit my mentor, Sam, for being such a patient and knowledgable mentor who have really taught me a lot and helped piqued my interest in marketing analytics.
And the purpose of this post is for me to consolidate, or attempt to consolidate my learnings of what marketing analytics means to me, for now at least.</description>
