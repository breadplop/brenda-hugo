      <description>Hello!
 What this post is about So today I am going to write about how I (1) created my first Telegram bot on python, and (2) manage to host it 24&amp;frasl;7 for free.
The reason I am writing this is because I had encountered some issues while looking for a beginner tutorial teaching me how to write telegram bots.
And after writing the bot, I wanted my bot to be live without having me to pay for anything.</description>
