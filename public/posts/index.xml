      <description>How I created an automated marketing dashboard on Google Spreadsheets Background Perhaps I should first provide some background/context on this project that I worked on. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, I am interning at a commercial real estate tech startup in NYC for a year as part of a school programme that my university provided.
So when I first entered my internship company, I noticed that sales/marketing data were all being tracked on Google Spreadsheets.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my legit first post Hello world, I have been wanting to start a blog for ages and today I finally got round to doing it, even though I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t as I have so many other things on my plate at this moment. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I manage to put inside some time to do this anyway.
People around me kept telling me that I should start a blog or portfolio of some sort to keep track of my progress, and also to have something to show for in the future.</description>
