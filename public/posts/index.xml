      <description>How to Use Python with Google Spreadsheets Intro I recently wanted to pull data from Google Spreadsheets, do some manipulation using Python, and push the cleaned data back onto Google Spreadsheets. And so I was resaerching on ways to connect read and write gspreadsheets with Python.
Upon Googling I realized that there are a few ways to do it, and yet many of them seems to be outdated. As of today, 8th May 2018, I have yet to figure it out.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my legit first post Hello world, I have been wanting to start a blog for ages and today I finally got round to doing it, even though I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t as I have so many other things on my plate at this moment. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I manage to put inside some time to do this anyway.
People around me kept telling me that I should start a blog or portfolio of some sort to keep track of my progress, and also to have something to show for in the future.</description>
