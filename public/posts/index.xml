      <description>I have always wanted to learn how to invest. I want to be self-sufficient. I want to stop taking my parent&amp;rsquo;s money. I want to be able to provide for myself and for the people I love. I want to grow money from money. And I know all of these aren&amp;rsquo;t going to come even if I manage to find a well paying job. I needed to do something more than find a good job.</description>

      <description>Hi guys, so today I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about marketing analytics. Being at Reonomy for a year, I have learnt a lot about marketing and how data is so important and crucial in marketing. I&amp;rsquo;d like to credit my mentor, Sam, for being such a patient and knowledgable mentor who have really taught me a lot and helped piqued my interest in marketing analytics.
And the purpose of this post is for me to consolidate, or attempt to consolidate my learnings of what marketing analytics means to me, for now at least.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my legit first post Hello world, I have been wanting to start a blog for ages and today I finally got round to doing it, even though I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t as I have so many other things on my plate at this moment. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I manage to put inside some time to do this anyway.
People around me kept telling me that I should start a blog or portfolio of some sort to keep track of my progress, and also to have something to show for in the future.</description>
