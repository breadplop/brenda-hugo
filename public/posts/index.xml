      <description>Welcome to my legit first post Hello world, I have been wanting to start a blog for ages and today I finally got round to doing it, even though I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t as I have so many other things on my plate at this moment. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I manage to put inside some time to do this anyway.
People around me kept telling me that I should start a blog or portfolio of some sort to keep track of my progress, and also to have something to show for in the future.</description>
