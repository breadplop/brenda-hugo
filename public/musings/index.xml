      <description>I just finished year 4 semester 1 today. Completed 2 papers today and I finally feel relieved. There is so much I want to do this holiday, but really very little time. I am going to list down some of the things that I want to do, or things that I will have to do, this holiday. Just so that I can better plan and delegate my time.
 I found myself a software development part-time job that I am quite excited about!</description>
