      <description>Hello!
 What this post is about So today I am going to write about how I (1) created my first Telegram bot on python, and (2) manage to host it 24&amp;frasl;7 for free.
The reason I am writing this is because I had encountered some issues while looking for a beginner tutorial teaching me how to write telegram bots.
And after writing the bot, I wanted my bot to be live without having me to pay for anything.</description>

      <description>How I created an automated/self-updating marketing dashboard on Google Spreadsheets Intro I recently wanted to pull data from Google Spreadsheets, do some manipulation using Python, and push the cleaned data back onto Google Spreadsheets. And so I was researching on ways to connect read and write gspreadsheets with Python.
Upon Googling I realized that there are a few ways to do it, and yet many of them seems to be outdated.</description>

      <description>Task As part of the product team, I was tasked to create analyze and construct product metrics so that we take a more systematic and data-driven approach when it comes to designing the product and strategizing company goals.
Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to evaluate and analyse the product performance overtime.
I made use of the Mixpanel API and company&amp;rsquo;s database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.</description>
