      <description>How I created an automated marketing dashboard on Google Spreadsheets Background Perhaps I should first provide some background/context on this project that I worked on. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, I am interning at a commercial real estate tech startup in NYC for a year as part of a school programme that my university provided.
So when I first entered my internship company, I noticed that sales/marketing data were all being tracked on Google Spreadsheets.</description>

      <description>Task Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to analyse the product performance overtime. I made use of the Mixpanel API and access to the company&amp;rsquo;s database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.
Some key charts include: Feature Audit Charts, Cohort Analysis Charts, Stickiness Ratio, Engagement Metrics
Problems Faced 1. 2. 3.
Lessons learnt 1. 2. 3.</description>
