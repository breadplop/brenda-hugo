      <description>How I created an automated/self-updating marketing dashboard on Google Spreadsheets Background Perhaps I should first provide some background/context on this project that I worked on. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know, I am interning at a commercial real estate tech startup in NYC for a year as part of a school programme that my university provided.
So when I first entered my internship company, I noticed that sales/marketing data were all being tracked on Google Spreadsheets.</description>

      <description>Task As part of the product team, I was tasked to create analyze and construct product metrics so that we take a more systematic and data-driven approach when it comes to designing the product and strategizing company goals.
Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to evaluate and analyse the product performance overtime.
I made use of the Mixpanel API and company&amp;rsquo;s database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.</description>
