      <description>Hi guys, so today I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about marketing analytics. Being at Reonomy for a year, I have learnt a lot about marketing and how data is so important and crucial in marketing. I&amp;rsquo;d like to credit my mentor, Sam, for being such a patient and knowledgable mentor who have really taught me a lot and helped piqued my interest in marketing analytics.
And the purpose of this post is for me to consolidate, or attempt to consolidate my learnings of what marketing analytics means to me, for now at least.</description>

      <description>How I created an automated/self-updating marketing dashboard on Google Spreadsheets Intro I recently wanted to pull data from Google Spreadsheets, do some manipulation using Python, and push the cleaned data back onto Google Spreadsheets. And so I was researching on ways to connect read and write gspreadsheets with Python.
Upon Googling I realized that there are a few ways to do it, and yet many of them seems to be outdated.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my legit first post Hello world, I have been wanting to start a blog for ages and today I finally got round to doing it, even though I really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t as I have so many other things on my plate at this moment. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad I manage to put inside some time to do this anyway.
People around me kept telling me that I should start a blog or portfolio of some sort to keep track of my progress, and also to have something to show for in the future.</description>

      <description>Task As part of the product team, I was tasked to create analyze and construct product metrics so that we take a more systematic and data-driven approach when it comes to designing the product and strategizing company goals.
Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to evaluate and analyse the product performance overtime.
I made use of the Mixpanel API and company&amp;rsquo;s database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.</description>
