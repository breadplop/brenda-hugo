I just finished year 4 semester 1 today. Completed 2 papers today and I finally feel relieved. There is so much I want to do this holiday, but really very little time. I am going to list down some of the things that I want to do, or things that I will have to do, this holiday. Just so that I can better plan and delegate my time.

- I found myself a software development part-time job that I am quite excited about! I have always wanted to give a shot down at software development
- I want to start creating my investment portfolio. Came by an opportunity where I am going to get a mentor, so I am quite excited for that
- I want to be able create weekly or biweekly posts, just for me to keep updated and accountable for my goals. 
- I also want to slowly start on my data engineering portfolio. I have been saying that I am interested in it for quite some time, but have NEVER got round to doing anything concrete about it.
- At the same time I am going to have multiple trainings. 
  
I don't know how I am going to do all of these, or commit to all of these. But I am really interested in all of those that I have listed above. Hopefully I will regularly blog about them and slowly make it a habit.
