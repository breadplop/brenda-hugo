Hi,

I recently started on my new job on the 1st July. It is a service engineering role, where I help to implement my company's product onto our client's servers and network. 
I am still pretty new in so I am still onboarding, trying to familarise myself with the tools used and also the new language that I would have to learn. I am excited but nervous at the same time.
The role of the SE, while crucial, isn't the most exciting or glamarous role. We don't get to work on the cool stuff like the development of the algorithms and software, and instead spend lots of our time debugging, testing and validating the tool. It is indeed not the best job out there. It does however give me a good perspective on the business. I am on the technical team that is in between the cients and the development team. I get to look through the developer's code, and have to help debug it when things go wrong. While I am eager to learn, a lot of it will be based on my initiative.

I am however growing to like the team? Initially the team was very quiet and aloof. The guy who I was tagged with came late to work everyday and was never really excited about his job. However after a 1-1 with our supervisor, his attitude towards work has changed. I think he is working hard to prove himself and hope that he will get to transfer over to the product team. 

I am curious to see how it turns out over the next few months. I want to prove myself worthy so that I will be able to work on projects I like better.

Take initiative
Show leadership
Enjoy the ride.
