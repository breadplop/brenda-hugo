## Task
Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to analyse the product performance overtime. 
I made use of the Mixpanel API and access to the company's database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.

Some key charts include: Feature Audit Charts, Cohort Analysis Charts, Stickiness Ratio, Engagement Metrics
