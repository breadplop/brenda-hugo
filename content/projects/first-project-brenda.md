## Task
As part of the product team, I was tasked to create analyze and construct product metrics so that we take a more systematic and data-driven approach when it comes to designing the product and strategizing company goals. 

Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to evaluate and analyse the product performance overtime. 

I made use of the Mixpanel API and company's database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.

*Key charts include: Feature Audit Charts, Cohort Analysis Charts, Stickiness Ratio, Engagement Metrics*

### Problems Faced
1. How to retrieve the data using APIs
2. How to create filters on the front-end which will reflect change on the charts immediately
3. Debugging

### Lessons learnt
1. How to use the Flask Framework to create a basic web application
2. How to structure the code to make it readable and repeatable

I will be writing about the process as the time passes.
