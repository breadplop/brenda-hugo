## Task
As part of the product team, I was tasked to create analyze and construct product metrics so that we take a more systematic and data-driven approach when it comes to designing the product and strategizing company goals. 

Using a Flask framework, I created a simple dashboard to evaluate and analyse the product performance overtime. 

I made use of the Mixpanel API and company's database to retrieve and manipulate the data in order to create these charts.

*Key charts include: Feature Audit Charts, Cohort Analysis Charts, Stickiness Ratio, Engagement Metrics*
