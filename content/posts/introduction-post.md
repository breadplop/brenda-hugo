## Welcome to my _legit_ first post
Hello world, I have been wanting to start a blog for ages and today I finally got round to doing it, even though I really shouldn't
as I have so many other things on my plate at this moment. But I'm glad I manage to put inside some time to do this anyway. 

People around me kept telling me that I should start a blog or portfolio of some sort to keep track of my progress, and also to have
something to show for in the future. I kept putting it off because I couldn't decide if I wanted to do it via a CMS like Medium or to 
use a static site generator like Hugo (which I am currently using now for this).

## What would this blog be for?
Well mostly I am going to write for myself. I believe I am going to write for 2 main reasons:

1. Personal Blog to write about random inspiration, musings, reflections, life in general [tag as _Personal_]
2. Various Learnings [_tag as _Learn_]

## Today's Inspiration
Anyway, before I sleep I am going to talk about my day today. So I met up with Mr Latif, my ex-PE teacher from NJ. I never knew he was such
an entrepreur and honestly also a very inspirational figure. He was telling me about how he set up his first business back when he was
third year in college. I _am_ in third year of college now, with no such achievement to speak, even though I am in this _entepreurship_ program right now in NYC, trying to learn and figure out how to be an entrepreneur. He isn't even 40 yet and is already looking to retire in the next couple of years. I was really inspired by him. If there is anything I took away from our short catch up today, it is that nothing comes easy. Work hard for what you want.

So.. jiayou bread. Don't give up.
