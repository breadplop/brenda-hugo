I have always wanted to learn how to invest. I want to be self-sufficient. I want to stop taking my parent's money. I want to be able to provide for myself and for the people I love. I want to grow money from money. And I know all of these aren't going to come even if I manage to find a well paying job. I needed to do something more than find a good job. Especially in this day and age, I needed to find additional sources of income. 

### What this post is about
Recently I went for a workshop titled *Investing 101*. It was a workshop organized by my boyfriend's uncle and he wanted to introduce the concept of investing to his A-level students. I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to get exposed to the topic. 

When I got to the workshop, I could see that the other attendees were a lot younger than me, I felt a litle embarrassed by was glad I am taking my first steps anyway. 

In this post, I will briefly talk about what I have learnt - just for me to ensure that I have learned, and also hopefully give anyone who is reading this post and like me, want to get involved in investing, some idea of how they can start this journey. We can learn together.

### What the workshop was about
This workshop didn't teach you to invest or anything. It taught us about the history, basics and fundamentals of investing. 

The first part was about the economy. 

- How money came about
- Why we need money
- How money gets its value

We then moved on to bigger topics:

- Different stock exchanges

Last part of the workshop, we learnt how to:

- read candle graphs

All in all, it was an enrichng workshop about the history of investments. I will be going down for another thsi saturday so teach me more basics on investing and I am excited to see what new knowledge I'd be able to pick up.
