Hi guys, so today I'd like to talk about marketing analytics. Being at Reonomy for a year, I have learnt a lot about marketing and how data is so important and crucial in marketing. I'd like to credit my mentor, Sam, for being such a patient and knowledgable mentor who have really taught me a lot and helped piqued my interest in marketing analytics. 

It is so important to be able to know and track how _effective_ your marketing campaigns truly are. One of the major difficulties the marketing industry face today is:

1. The accuracy of the data that is being tracked
2. How to draw insights from it

Something that the industry is still lacking in is linking up marketing-sales information.
