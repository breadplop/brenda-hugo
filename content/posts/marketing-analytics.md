Hi guys, so today I'd like to talk about marketing analytics. Being at Reonomy for a year, I have learnt a lot about marketing and how data is so important and crucial in marketing. I'd like to credit my mentor, Sam, for being such a patient and knowledgable mentor who have really taught me a lot and helped piqued my interest in marketing analytics. 

And the purpose of this post is for me to consolidate, or attempt to consolidate my learnings of what marketing analytics means to me, for now at least. I am still in the process of learning much more but I thought it would be helpful to pen down a few key learnings along the way for me to reflect upon what I am doing

It is so important to be able to know and track how _effective_ your marketing campaigns truly are. One of the major difficulties the marketing industry face today is:

1. The accuracy of the data that is being tracked
2. How to draw insights from it
3. How to sync marketing-sales information

I am more of a visual person and less of a _words_ person, so I consolidated my thoughts and learnings in the following image:

All of these seems simple. I have probably learnt about it before in class. But in reality, it is so difficult (or at least for me) to put into practice. There needs to be a conscious effort to be aware about these details. These are things I have honestly taken for granted back in school - what it means to collect the data, question the data. 

I have spent about 2-3 weeks putting together a dashboard that Sam thought was really useful, only to realise that the data in there isn't entirely accurate. We will now need to spend some time to clean up and ensure that the data in there is good, which is honestly a very tedious task - but it has to be done. 

> It is always a work in progress.
